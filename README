Gtk2::GLExt version 0.90
========================

The Gtk2::GLExt module allows a Perl developer to use GtkGLExt, an OpenGL
extension to GTK+ by Naofumi Yasufuku (°ÂÊ¡ ¾°Ê¸), with Gtk2-Perl.

Like the Gtk2 module on which it depends, Gtk2::GLExt follows the C API
of gtkglext as closely as possible while still being perlish.
Thus, the C API reference remains the canonical documentation.

You can find out everything you need to know about GtkGLExt at its homepage,
http://gtkglext.sourceforge.net

This module does not include actual OpenGL bindings; you need to get those
separately.  Search CPAN for OpenGL, SDL::OpenGL, and PDL::Graphics::OpenGL;
your mileage may vary.

To discuss gtk2-perl, ask questions and flame/praise the authors,
join gtk-perl-list@gnome.org at lists.gnome.org.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


To avoid installing to a system directory, since this is a beta release,
you can change the installation prefix at Makefile.PL time with

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/other/place

This will install the module to the subdirectory lib/perl5 under the given
prefix.  If this is not already in perl's include path, you'll need to tell
perl how to get to this library directory so you can use it; there are three
ways:

  in your environment (the easiest):
    # assuming a bourne-style shell
    PERL5LIB=/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl
    export PERL5LIB

  on the perl command line:
    perl -I /some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl yourscript

  in the code of your perl script:
    use lib '/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl';
